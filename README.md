After 13 years of personal experience in computing, I decided to change my hobby into a career in 2001. After finishing up my associate’s degree at Bluegrass Community & Technical College, I decided to further my education at Sullivan University with a bachelor’s in Information Technology. Now I has 20 plus professional years as a systems administrator and 30 years experience as a technologist. I started my career as an administrator at Belcan Engineering supporting Unix and Windows systems for Sikorsky Aircraft  and GE Aviation. I then worked as a systems administrator at Lexmark migrating their systems to a private VMware cloud. Missing Cincinnati, I moved back to my hometown to work at CenterGrid where I filled a devops Linux Chef administrator roll supporting five to six hundred VMware guests on several IBM BladeCenter chassis. Currently I am working at GE avication as a Staff Infrastructure Architect working mainly with AWS and Linxu systems. 

For fun, I normally works full time in technology and keeps a fully functional 42U server rack at home. When I is not living tech, I am spends time with his family.
